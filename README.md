<br>The `blue-yonder` [package](https://pypi.org/project/blue-yonder/) is a pypi Python package that allows you to program your own ['simple automation'](./sa/README.md) (SA) of routine tasks on BlueSky.

<br>The `wild-blue-yonder` [package](https://pypi.org/project/wild-blue-yonder/) makes it possible for you to instruct a Language Model how to manage your Actor on Bluesky network. Here you will find several useful examples of this new type of ['intelligent automation'](./ia/README.md) (IA).

## Begin with the basics!
But first I recommend you to [start reading there](./basics/README.md). These simple examples will help you start your programmatic interactions with the Bluesky network.
